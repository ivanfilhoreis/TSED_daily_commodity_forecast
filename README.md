# TSED - Commodities

Time-Series Enriched with Domain-specific terms to forecasting the daily future price of agricultural commodities.

# Method

The proposed method, a representation of time-series combined with features extracted from a vector representation of texts. Below illustrates the steps performed in the method.

</p>

# Experimental Configuration

The cross-validation for time-series was used to evaluate the proposed model in the experimental evaluation. The first training step was performed with 30% of the data (F1), and at each cross-validation iteration, a day is added to the training to predict the next step ahead.

The variable yâ€² in Equation 8 represents the forecast of commodity prices h days ahead, and n represents approximately 1230 forecasts (daily) performed in the test stage.

# Results

Figure below shows the graph of the true and forecasted values of commodities with forecasting horizon h = 1. The red and blue points represent the days when the forecast reached the MAPE equal to zero.
